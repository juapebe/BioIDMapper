README FOR PC204 INSTRUCTORS

BioIDMapper is a program that aims to address a question I consider interesting for my own research.

I originally intended to be able to generate .PDB files as output, with the peptides mapped into protein. That has not been possible due to time constrains but the output files (a GenomeDiagram sketch diagram with the position of the peptides inside the protein sequence) already provide some information.

Most importantly, I have set a couple of classes and methods that will allow to expand this piece of software in the future.

A sample file is provided: peptides.txt. It is the output of a real experiment from my research. Output will be obtained upon running.
